# Functional Reactive with Core Java - the frameworkless way

## Teaser
In this workshop we will walk through building a 
functional reactive application w/o the aid of external frameworks, 
relying only on the capabilities of the JDK. 

The URL to the event is [Meetup JavaIL 255867803](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/JavaIL/events/255867803/)

## Bird Eye View
What we want to learn is , how we can code in a functional and reactive way 
only using the JDK itself. So many different frameworks and libs are on the market.
Even functional languages taht are running on the JVM. But often you can not 
deal with a complete different Collections framework or language only to 
have a more functional or reactive approach.

We will have a look at possibilities to code pure java in a functional / reactive way.

We will start with the functional aspects to make the code 
stateless and compact. After we reached this goal, we are ready to make it reactive..


## Timeline

First we will have a 30min theoretical part of the 
content we want to work with during the Hands On Lab.
The slides are provided, plus ...
